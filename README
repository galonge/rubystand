== Welcome to RubyStand

RubyStand is a simple gallery app written in Ruby on Rails 3.1

== Getting Started

RubyStand is build on the following:

* database free
* relies on plain image files on the disk
* defines albums as sets of images
* each album can have title, year and a description
* expects thumbnails along with normal files (will be automated in future versions)
* can read basic metadata about albums and photos from YAML files

== Installation

Note that asset pipelining is NOT used.

Simply install by 'bundle install'


== Configuration
Make sure you put all of your albums (as directories) into 'public/data'
Each album directory has to have 'thumb' directory with image thumbnails (thumbnail creation will be automatic in future versions)
